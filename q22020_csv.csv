Viacyte,27,5/27/2020,Biotechnology,San Diego,California,Bain Capital Life Sciences - Ra Capital Management - Sanderling Ventures - TPG Capital ,"ViaCyte is a preclinical therapeutic company focused on diabetes.  Our therapy is based on the differentiation of stem cells into pancreatic beta cell precursors, with subcutaneous implantation in an encapsulation device.  Data in our publications demonstrates that these cells can produce therapeutically relevant levels of insulin in response to blood glucose, and sustain diabetic animals.  Our goal is a product which can free both Type 1 and Type 2 patients with diabetes from insulin dependence on a long-term basis, while reducing or eliminating hypoglycemic, microvasculature, and weight-related cardiovascular complications. Our work to date has been based on human ES (embryonic stem) cell lines of our own development.  This has allowed us to do the research that underlies our publications and patents.  As iPS (induced pluripotent stem) cell technology advances, we anticipate that it will replace ES cells.  Thus we have established collaborations with leading iPS research groups and have increasing experience and IP based on application of our differentiation technology to this alternate starting material. ViaCyte was the first company to develop human ES cell lines under GMP conditions.  As we move into definitive preclinical studies, in preparation for submission of an IND, we are also migrating our differentiation technology and encapsulation device to GMP / QSR compliance. ViaCyte is a private, venture-capital backed company.  We have also received important support from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF). The business opportunity for ViaCyte is substantial.  Revenue worldwide from diabetes therapeutics totaled over $35 billion in 2010, up over 100% from 2003.  ViaCyte believes that its products, if successfully developed and approved by regulatory agencies, could take significant share in this rapidly growing market. ViaCyte, Inc. is headquartered in San Diego, California with additional operations in Athens, Georgia. The company was founded in 1999 as Novocell, Inc, merged with CyThera and Bresagen in 2004, and changed its name to ViaCyte in 2010. ",biotechnology
