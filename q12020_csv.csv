Roblox,150,2/27/2020,Software,Redwood City,California,Andreessen Horowitz,"ROBLOX is a service that provides games based on user-created content. ROBLOX games only run on www.roblox.com. So if you make a cool ROBLOX game, most likely you will not find a foreign website where your game can be played. Unlike a book, movie, music track or Flash game, a lot more than a simple ""player"" is required to run a ROBLOX game. The ROBLOX infrastructure includes an asset farm, game servers, web services boxes, matchmaking servers and more backend technology. We support technological innovation-hey, that's why we started ROBLOX! We're excited to see that new distribution mechanisms are allowing consumers to get content more cheaply and ubiquitously, while simultaneously getting more money in the hands of content producers. We also recognize the need to take down offending content, which is why we support the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). If at some point in the future ROBLOX made it possible for developers to make money from their games, this service business model would help ROBLOX developers by making it difficult for others to steal their games. In the meantime, ROBLOX believes that content producers should be protected and paid. SOPA, on the other hand, will reduce payments to artists by strengthening the status quo (specifically, expensive and less ubiquitous distribution of media). This bill also threatens free speech by granting sweeping authority to individuals. As such, we cannot in good conscience support SOPA. It is understandable how well-intentioned people might feel that a law such as SOPA would combat overseas piracy, however we strenuously urge our representatives in Congress to consider the points mentioned in this post and to oppose SOPA.
